          “Get the fuck outta my seat,” he grunts. I know the routine. I look
          up, avoid eye contact, and search for a new seat immediately. Two rows
          ahead, I spot one. I get up, grab my travel bag, and slink past my
          Brute teammate. I slide into my new seat beside Alex, a Venezuelan
          player, oblivious to everything except for the music coming from his
          headphones, and tuck myself against the window. I mumble, “Gracias,
          Alex.” He nods in acknowledgement and goes back to listening to the
          bachata sounds of Aventura. I’m 19 years old and in the Cincinnati
          Reds minor league system, playing at their Midwest League, low minor
          league level. Joining professional baseball out of high school was my
          dream. I was a skinny, shy, passive Canadian kid. I knew almost
          nothing about the rigors of the professional sports world but was
          finding out quickly. Whether in the team’s locker room, at the hotel,
          or on the field. I found myself feeling out of place. Maybe it was my
          introverted nature or my lack of high-level competition. Maybe it was
          because I ended every sentence like a question, eh? I had no friends
          on my team, and most of the time, I kept to myself. I was so scared of
          making a mistake and looking foolish out loud. As weird as my
          teammates must have already thought I was, I worried opening my mouth
          would make things worse. I felt most out of place on the bus. Imagine
          these Greyhound-style buses. Carpet seating with cigarette holes and
          old gum stuck on them. Broken armrests, missing headrests, and
          non-existent A/C. Massive windows that were dangerously unsealed. They
          would open and flap like an uncaged bird as we flew down the freeway.
          And the smells. Smells that come to mind: smoke, urine, feces,
          ammonia… How, why? Our bus was a landfill. Empty Gatorade bottles,
          snack wrappers, soiled Kleenex, why is there a used condom on the
          floor? Random stinky socks, stained underwear, wet towels, dirty
          everything, everywhere. God forbid you must use the bathroom because
          getting there was a labyrinth of legs, bodies, bags, speakers, and
          card games. Oh, and if you’re really lucky, fist fights with slumping
          players in foul moods. When you finally make it, if you ever do,
          imagine a port o’ potty straight out of Ghoulies. Soap? Please, we
          didn’t even have running water. Most times, it was just you and a
          toilet full of monsters. While other times, they showed up at the
          bathroom door at 3 a.m. While everyone was asleep one night, I
          desperately needed to use the restroom. I plug my nose and try to get
          in and out as fast as possible. Still holding my breath, I turn the
          door handle to open the door. No luck. Confused, I push harder.
          Nothing. There’s a sinister chuckle on the other side. “Hey, come on,
          I’m tired. Let me out”, I say. “Fuck you, pussy”. I realize what’s
          happening now, and I panic. I want out, but the Brute is trapping me
          inside the bathroom. I’m screaming on the inside. My eyes well up with
          tears. I want to go home and feel safe. A different teammate
          approaches the restroom and tells the Brute, “Hey, I need to piss.”
          The door opens. I brush past my hero teammate, avoid eye contact, and
          return to my seat. Everyone did what they could to make their time in
          this hell more bearable. Sometimes, I’d bring my pillow, while others
          would travel with things to put in their mouths. Sunflower seeds, gum,
          energy bars, and, of course, tobacco. Tobacco, AKA my kryptonite. How
          could anyone like that stuff? The guys used it all day, every day. Dip
          or chew, as they would call it. Scan a professional baseball room back
          then, and you’d have seen nothing but brown drool oozing from lumps in
          lips and cheeks. It would stink up every location we shared. Every
          bottle, cup, can, or container needed to be double-checked before
          drinking from it; if not, you could drink someone’s special blend of
          tobacco and warm spit. I tried tobacco once and immediately threw up.
          I stayed as far away from it as possible, which, on the bus, was
          nearly impossible because of how many of my teammates thrived on it.
          With the amount of competing and traveling we did on the road,
          sleeping on the bus was inevitable. Sitting two by two, some would
          fall asleep on their neighbor’s shoulder and some, cramped against a
          flapping window. Then there was the third option, sleeping on the
          floor. Between your seat and the seats in front of you, there is a
          small space where you can slip into and get a flat surface. This area
          is HOT; you can feel the heat from outside, off the vents, and even
          from the engine. But the big reward was that you could stretch your
          legs across the aisle. This was the luxurious route I would take. I
          can’t tell you how much real sleep I got down there. It was as if the
          heat, the vibration of the bus, and the enclosed space were perfect
          for rest. No matter how hot and sweaty, the minute I hit the floor, I
          was off to LaLa land. This was my spot, my den, my backup bed for the
          four years I rode those buses. I also knew every minute of sleep was
          necessary to achieve my big dream of reaching the major leagues. The
          best part of bus travel was when we traveled through varied terrain or
          cities and towns I would’ve never encountered. Sometimes, I felt like
          I was watching magic happen out of the front window as the bus drivers
          would safely navigate us to our next stop. One night, while traveling
          through winding and hilly roads, our bus driver and I were the only
          ones with our eyes open. I’m standing in the aisle in awe as we rumble
          and screech on to our next destination. We drive down a steep hill
          with sharp curves, and it feels like, right before every curve, we’re
          going to fall off the cliff. I watch Gatorade, water, and juice
          bottles drop to the floor and roll around the bus as we curve left and
          right. The lids would oftentimes be half-tightened, and the contents
          would spill open and cascade across the floor. Finally, I snap out of
          the hypnotizing dance of the bottles and realize it’s time to tuck
          myself into my nook on the floor and get some sleep. I find my usual
          spot, and it’s hot as soon as I get down there. Like, REALLY hot, but
          almost immediately, I’m sleeping so well. I dream of standing on the
          field in packed stadiums, being interviewed, bright lights, signing
          big contracts, and accepting awards. These grand dreams were a stark
          contrast to my current reality. Because although I was trying my best,
          nothing seemed to be going right on the field. Joining the minor
          leagues was nothing like I expected. I thought I would perform better,
          move faster up the ranks, and have more fun with my teammates.
          Instead, it was isolating, unglamorous, and humbling. I felt like a
          fool. My dream suddenly cuts out when a smell wakes me up… It’s
          distinct and all too familiar. Tobacco. Groggy and nauseous, I feel my
          face soaked in sweat. The sweat flows down my nose and lips. I rub my
          face and look at my hand. My hand is covered in a brown liquid, black
          even. I give my hand a curious look: brown, black!? What is this? I
          sniff the sludge. It’s not sweat. I’m covered in someone’s tobacco
          spit! I look at the floor next to me and realize I’m lying in a pool
          of it. The bottle still rolls and bumps around me as tobacco drips
          into my mouth. I wipe my face again; it’s soaked, and my face is
          completely covered. Gross. No. Disgusting. In the dark, I see Brute’s
          grinning teeth and eyes loving what he’s seeing. I pause for a
          second…But there is no processing. No asking: What should I do? What
          am I going to do? There is no panic, no anger, no longing for
          something different. I don’t know if it was because I had just woken
          up from visions of my future or if I was too exhausted even to react,
          but at that moment, there was nothing else: this was my life, my
          calling, everything I wanted. I needed to live through and accept all
          the intimidating, lonely, uncomfortable, insurmountable, and
          vomit-inducing parts that come with it. I lift my shirt and wipe my
          face, turn my head in the other direction and go back to falling
          soundly asleep. We’re headed to our next stop. I should rest up; I
          have a dream to get back to.
