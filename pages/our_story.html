          Medium is a home for human stories and ideas. Here, anyone can share
          insightful perspectives, useful knowledge, and life wisdom with the
          world—without building a mailing list or a following first. The
          internet is noisy and chaotic; Medium is quiet yet full of insight.
          It’s simple, beautiful, collaborative, and helps you find the right
          audience for whatever you have to say. We believe that what you read
          and write matters. Words can divide or empower us, inspire or
          discourage us. In a world where the most sensational and surface-level
          stories often win, we’re building a system that rewards depth, nuance,
          and time well spent. A space for thoughtful conversation more than
          drive-by takes, and substance over packaging. Ultimately, our goal is
          to deepen our collective understanding of the world through the power
          of writing. Over 100 million people connect and share their wisdom on
          Medium every month. Many are professional writers, but just as many
          aren’t — they’re CEOs, computer scientists, U.S. presidents, amateur
          novelists, and anyone burning with a story they need to get out into
          the world. They write about what they’re working on, what’s keeping
          them up at night, what they’ve lived through, and what they’ve learned
          that the rest of us might want to know too. Instead of selling ads or
          selling your data, we’re supported by a growing community of Medium
          members who align with our mission. If you’re new here, start
          exploring. Dive deeper into whatever matters to you. Find a post that
          helps you learn something new, or reconsider something familiar—and
          then share your own story.
